Oh Pestilence is here! Finally a horseman who I can get along with. 


@@Pestilence 
Cthulhu! The place looks amazing, very rotten and horrible 


@@Cthulhu
Hahaha, thank you! Are you excited for the end of the world? 

@@Pestilence
Oh yes, I have my fun corrupting people into being anti-vax and anti-science but there is nothing more fun than a plague 


@@Ctulhu 
Well just wait for a few more hours and you can create a dozen plagues with Azathoth!


@@Pestilence
How exciting!
