And sent! Phew, it’s a little close to the party but I’m sure the horsemen can sense the impending doom coming even if they lose their invite. 


@@ Cthulhu
Maybe if I’m lucky, they’ll start to feel FOMO when other horsemen get here and they’ll race their way over here to my party! 


@@ Cthulhu
I still can’t believe Azathoth is finally waking up soon. Only 24 hours left! Hopefully he will enjoy the party when he wakes up and starts the end of the world. 


@@ Cthulhu
Nothing must go wrong! I swear on my name! 

@@ Cthulhu
Wait, a horseman is already here!? But we haven’t fully finished the food! The music isn’t even on! Aaa!


@@ Cthulhu
I need to get this party started!
